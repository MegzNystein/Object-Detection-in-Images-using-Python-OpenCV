# Object-Detection-in-Images-using-Python-OpenCV

In this project I have used Python and OPenCV to detect objects in Images. To get a hang of it, download the files and run the tutorial.py file in your terminal, to do so type "python tutorial.py" in your terminal. 

The output consists of colored lines drawn around objects present in the Image.
